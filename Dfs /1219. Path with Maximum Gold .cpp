//Time complexity:O(v * 3^v), where v is the number of non- zero cells
//Space complexity: O(n * m)

// In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.

// Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

// -> Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
// -> From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
// -> You can't visit the same cell more than once.
// -> Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
// -> You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
